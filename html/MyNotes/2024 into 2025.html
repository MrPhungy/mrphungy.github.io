                    <p>Even though we're a quarter into 2025, I have much to say about 2024. I'm not sure if it's just me, but these past couple years have been a blur to me. It's hard to believe that it's been 4 years since the dreaded pandemic. With that, I have much to say about 2024. Where do I begin?</p>

                        <h2>School</h2> <!-- Subheading for the introduction -->
                        <p>This year was quite the academic milestone for me. I'm now finished with all of my non-computer science classes. I can say goodbye to linear algebra, discrete mathematics, and graph theory. Finally!! From here on out, there will be only COSC courses. Although daunting, I have much to look forward to and tons of new concepts to absorb. </p>

                        <h2>Life</h2> <!-- Subheading for the introduction -->
                        <p>I'd have to say that 2024 has treated me very kindly. It feels as if I'm veering in the right direction to where I'd like to be in life. Mentally, I feel less stressed. Less tired. There were times in the past when I felt as if I were fighting against myself. Two minds clashing about whether or not I deserve this blessed life that has been given to me. But I’m fortunate to know that my friends and family will always be there to help me through life’s most difficult moments. </p>
    
                        <p>Also, I recently came across a film that changed my perspective on life: <i>Perfect Days (2023).</i> Highly recommend giving it a watch.</p>

                        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                        <p>
                            If there's anything I've improved on the most during 2024, it's my steaks. I don't mean to brag, but I make a damn good steak. Pan-seared, reverse-seared, grilled, sous vide-you name it, I've done it. The ribeye discounts I get from my part-time job at HEB sure help quite a bit.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I've put an indefinite pause on my quest to become the best Pokemon trainer in Pokemon Go and picked up Marvel Rivals instead. I have to say, it's been one of the most fun games I've played in a very long time. I'm proud to say that I've reached Grandmaster II. I know, I'm super cool. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            However, putting a pause on PoGo doesn't mean  I've stopped collecting Pokemon cards. I've amassed a financially dangerous amount cards in 2024—including the holy grail of <i>Paldean Fates</i>, the Bubble Mew. Sadly, I still have to live with the fact that Han's collection is cooler than mine.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I recently picked up the oddly fun game of pickleball. My uncle introduced me to it, and I've been playing it more ever since.  Han and I like to play in our free time, though not as much as we’d like. Maybe that'll change in 2025. For now though, I can blame my losses on my $15 paddle.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Travel</h2>
                        <p>
                            The family and I took a road trip to the good ol’ Sunshine State this year—specifically, Indian Rock Beach. It felt like a much-needed trip, considering how rare it is for all of us to find time off from our busy lives. Tropical fruits, beach volleyball, and family dinners were definitely the highlights. The 14-hour drive however? Not so fun.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            To finish off the year, I also took a family trip to Disneyland! It was my first time, as well as my cousin Lucas’ first time going. We spent a fun-filled day at the park, enjoying it as if we were kids again. After riding every single ride, I can confidently say that Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run was the best ride experience I’ve ever had. Baby Lucas also seemed to have the time of his life. The rest of the trip was filled with good eats and memorable experiences.

                        <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>
                            2024 was a great year, and it set the bar high for 2025. I've learned to appreciate the small moments in life, because they'll become memories before you know it. Wishing everyone a great 2025! 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Catch y'all in the next one.
